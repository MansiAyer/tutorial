Accessible labels are necessary to make several other types of elements
understandable, such as inputs, widgets, and ARIA landmark regions.
Accessible labels that create a delightful experience are:

1. Concise -- 1 to 3 simple words. Only occasionally as many as 5 words.
1. Meaningful -- accurately convey the purpose of the element.

There are many ways to label an interactive element such as a button or an input field, which you will see below. You can check the results of adding the various label types by testing in your screen reader too!
