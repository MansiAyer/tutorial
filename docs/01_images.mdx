Screen readers interact with text on the screen. So, to convey the meaning of an image to screen reader users, we put an accessible text label in the HTML. If an image is decorative, we can hide it from screenreader users by giving it an empty label (`alt=""`). After completing the exercise below, you can learn a lot more about writing good alt text for images by checking out [WebAIM's resource on the topic](http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

## An Accessible Inline Image

This is an image with an alt text. Turn on VoiceOver if you are on a Mac, tab to the Editor Output section, and use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Opt</kbd> + <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> to navigate to these images. VoiceOver will announce the alt text. For the second image below, VoiceOver will not announce anything meaningful since there is no alt text.

```jsx live
<img alt="Teach Access Bridge logo" src="../img/inline-image.png" />
```

## Inaccessible Inline Image exercise

This is an image without alt text. Turn on VoiceOver and listen to how it is read. Add an `alt` attribute "Teach Access Bridge logo" to this image to make it accessible and test it again with VoiceOver.

```jsx live
<img src="../img/inline-image.png" />
```

<VerifyButton
  error="It doesn't look like you added an alt to your image."
  checkExercise={() => {
    const images = Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName("img"));
    return images.every((image) => Boolean(image.alt));
  }}
></VerifyButton>
