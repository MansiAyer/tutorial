# Docusaurus migration challenge ðŸš€

The [Teach Access tutorial](https://teachaccess.github.io/tutorial/) was built in the [exerslide](https://github.com/facebookarchive/exerslide) framework, which was archived several years ago. In the last week of Hacktoberfest, we're making a challenge to migrate to [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus)!

1. Fork `teachaccess/tutorial`
1. `git checkout docusaurus`
1. `cd website`
1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn start` (you should now see the docusaurus tutorial load in your browser)
1. Locate the [current implementation in GitHub](https://github.com/teachaccess/tutorial/tree/master/slides) for the slide you're updating
1. Locate the live version in the [tutorial](https://teachaccess.github.io/tutorial/)
1. Recreate the same functionality in [docusaurus](https://github.com/teachaccess/tutorial/tree/docusaurus/docs)
1. If using VSCode, add this [MDX extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silvenon.mdx) for syntax highlighting
1. Open PR against `docusaurus` ðŸŽ‰

Check out the Headings slide for an example of live code exercises in docusaurus. See [before](https://github.com/teachaccess/tutorial/blob/master/slides/02-Developers/01-headings.html.md) and [after](https://github.com/teachaccess/tutorial/blob/docusaurus/docs/code/headings.mdx)
